Chat
====

That one was a project from my Internetwork Protocols class at Portland 
State University. Our job was create an multi-client chat using a IRC-like 
protocol. It is all written in Python and uses "select" library to manage 
the sockets.

You can find the protocol specification in the RFC file. All the instructions 
to run the client and the server can be find on their respective README 
files.
